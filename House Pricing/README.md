<h2>README</h2>
Using the California House Pricing data, I have implemented an Artificial Neural Network using Keras API to predict the house prices.</br>
I have also created log files to visualize the performance metrics using Tensorboard.</br>
With time, I'll also perform an extensive EDA alongside deployment on one of the clouds.
